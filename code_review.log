Suggestions for chunk 1: Suggestions on improving the code quality:
- Use a more descriptive variable name instead of 'not_prime'. For example, use 'is_odd' or 'is_even'.
- Consider using a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur during the count_prime_number function.
- You can also add comments to explain what each section of code does so that it is easier for others to understand and modify the code in the future.

Sorting suggestions list by priority from high to low:
1. Add a comment explaining the purpose of the function to make it more understandable.
2. Use descriptive variable names instead of 'count' or 'sum'. For example, use 'total_number_found' or 'num_of_prime_numbers'.
3. Consider using a loop that iterates through all numbers from 2 to the range end to find prime numbers. This will make the code more efficient and easier to read.
